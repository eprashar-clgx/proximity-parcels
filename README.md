### Summary
**Product Vision**
Empower customers to achieve more in less time. More specifically, help them in identification of zones of interest by applying the concept of proximity on strategically relevant infrastructure and environmental layers of interest. 
*Go beyond what and where is the parcel… to what is near the parcel.* 

**Product Description**
Proximity Parcels (v1.0) is a Location Intelligence bulk data product that can be leveraged to obtain proximity insights with respect to five feature layers – Roadways, Railway Lines, Transmission Lines, Protected Areas and Wetlands – for every parcel in the United States. 

Proximity indicators and impact metrics are calculated for each feature layer separately, and are available as a grouping(s). Along with these values, we also provide entity metadata for feature values. Customers can obtain one or more of these groupings based on their needs.
